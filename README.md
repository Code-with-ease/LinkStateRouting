# LinkStateRouting

app.py implements link state routing using Dijkstra's Algorithm while dial.py implements the same using Dial's Algorithm (Optimized Dijkstra's for small range weights).

app1.txt and app2.txt are the test cases to run in app.py 
dial1.txt and dial2.txt are the test cases to run in dial.py
